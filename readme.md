# GNN model for BP GB total energy prediction
The Jupyter Notebook demonstrate the process of transffering blue phosphorene (BP) grain boundary (GB) structures into graphs and training of a graph neural network model (GNN) for the total energy prediction. File [gnn_downsample_mae_tersoff](gnn_downsample_mae_tersoff.csv) contains all the data for downsampling the complete Tersoff dataset discussed in the paper.Training labels are the energy value evaluated by LAMMPS and a in-house fited Tersoff potential.
