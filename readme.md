# GNN model for BP GB total energy prediction
The Jupyter Notebook demonstrate the process of transffering blue phosphorene (BP) grain boundary (GB) structures into graphs and training of a graph neural network model (GNN) for the total energy prediction. Training labels are generated by LAMMPS and a Tersoff potential.
